# About

* Match and Find VBA : Use this on workbook <Mar_Apr_Sales.xlsx>. It compares three sheets, then either append items to the left or to the end depending on whether it shows up before or not. It also does some cleaning and filtering afterwards.
* yfind VBA : Use this on workbook <yfind_Excel.xlsx>. It looks for "y" row by row and delete all rows without "y".
* Transform Container VBA : Use this on an empty worksheet. Before using it, Container_Arrangement.xlsx needs to be downloaded, and the file_dir in the VBA needs to be changed correspondingly. It changes the original multiple container columns to a single column, and changes the original single date column to multiple columns while keeping everything else the same.
