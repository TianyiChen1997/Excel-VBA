# What this VBA does
It is for Summary TA and IP update. There are 6 Summary files, namely <ONZ.xlsx>, <CNZ.xlsx>, <SCB.xlsx>, <OCG.xlsx>, <AFN.xlsx>, and <CDM.xlsx>. You should pick one of them, run the VBA, then you will have your Summary updated.

# What this file contains
Summary TA IP VBA : It is the VBA to run.\
POS_01.01.2000.xlsx and ta.csv : These two need to be downloaded in the same folder, and may remain closed before running the VBA.\
All other excel file : These 6 files are all Summary files. You may pick any one of them to run the VBA on. They are all indepdent of each other.

# How it works
1. Make sure all the excel files are downloaded in the same folder, and make sure the file_dir in the VBA has changed correspondingly. 
2. Open any one of the Summary files, namely <ONZ.xlsx>, <CNZ.xlsx>, <SCB.xlsx>, <OCG.xlsx>, <AFN.xlsx>, and <CDM.xlsx>.
3. Run sub "Summary_TA_IP", and we are done.
