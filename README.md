# Weekly Restock

It is for Rotor/Pad Weekly Restock Summary. It updates the "Total Amount" data and "PowerBI Sales" data, cleans up the worksheets, and calculates the "Buy Qty".  There are two subs, <Rotor/Pad Cleanup> and <Rotor/Pad Buy>. One is for cleanup and data update, and the other one is for calculation. They are called together under the sub <Rotor/Pad Weekly>.
