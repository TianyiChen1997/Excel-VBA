# Excel VBA Overview

I write VBA code for process automation, report automation, table template conversion automation, and more.

Note: All files are uploaded for demonstration purpose only. They are the simplified version of the original files, and all numbers in the files are randomly generated.

## Currently Available:

* "Weekly Restock" for update, cleanup, and calculation for the Weekly Restock Summary

* "Daily PO" for daily purchase

* "Summary TA IP" for TA and IP update for any of the Summary Excel files

* More VBA code in the "Others" folder
