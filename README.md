# Excel-VBA
I write these codes to speed up some of my repetitive daily works.


Currently available: <Rotor/Pad weekly restock template update> basic structures (TA and PBI sales update)

Working on: <Rotor/Pad weekly restock template update> fine tuning (change formulas based on today's date, get other excel sheets data without opening the sheets,
  purchased parts update, calculate buy qty, and afterwards)
 
 
 Planning: daily restock (need check purchased parts first...)
