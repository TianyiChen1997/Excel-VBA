# Weekly Restock

It is for Rotor and Pad weekly restock summary. It updates the "Total Amount" data and "PowerBI Sales" data, cleans up the worksheets, and calculates the "Buy Qty". There are two mods, one for cleanup and data update, and one for calculation, and each mod contains the rotor and pad version. 

Important: You should run the Rotor/Pad_Cleanup sub first, then updates the Purchased Parts manually, and then run the Rotor/Pad_Buy sub to calculate.
