# Rotor/Pad Weekly Restock

It is for Rotor and Pad weekly restock summary. It updates the "Total Amount" data and "PowerBI Sales" data, cleans up the worksheets, and calculates the "Buy Qty". There are two mods, <Weekly Update Cleanup> and <Weekly Buy Amount>. One is for cleanup and data update, and the other one is for calculation. Both mods contain the rotor sub and pad sub.
  
Steps: 1. Open your summary excel file. 2. Run the Rotor/Pad_Cleanup sub. 3. Enter purchased qty manually. (For rotor, copy & paste data from Purchased Parts. For Pad, just type in the qty.) 4. Run the Rotor/Pad_Buy sub, and we are done.
