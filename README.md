I write these codes to speed up some of my repetitive daily works.


Currently available: <Rotor/Pad weekly restock template> for update and cleanup purpose

Working on: <Rotor/Pad weekly restock template add-on>, i.e purchased parts update, calculate buy qty, and afterwards
 
 
 Planning: daily restock (need check purchased parts first...)
