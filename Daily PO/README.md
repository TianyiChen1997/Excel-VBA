It is for daily purchase. It indicates which orders are bought already, and updates them in the <Purchased Parts (Pad + Rotor)> excel workbook automatically. If not bought, then generates a new workbook called <qbp.csv> and a list to search them easily on other websites. 

Run the VBA on workbook <po_wo_20220415>. Three subs need to be run. Run the "Daily_1" sub at the very beginning, then search orders on QBP using the newly generated <qbp.csv>, and then run the "Daily_2" sub to generate the list needed for Transbec search, and lastly run the "Daily_3" sub to copy & paste data to the original workbook <po_wo_20220415-0715S.xlsx> and color them.
